# Changelog

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

This release ships some fixes and enhancements. Additionally we renamed some attributes and model-classes. If you already used [v2.0.0](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java/releases/tag/v2.0.0) it might be needed to fix these changes.

### Refactoring
- [#86](../../../issues/86) add "payable" attribute to AccountResult-model

### Fixes
- [#85](../../../issues/85) AeternalService: fix case-sensitive comparison of domains
- [#88](../../../issues/88) replace Optional.orElse with Optional.orElseGet in the AccountServiceImpl

### Enhancements
- [#84](../../../issues/84) add missing ÆNS related AeternalService functionalities
   - we added the possibility to query for active names
   and search for a name (which allows to receive e.g. the owner of a name)
- [#87](../../../issues/87) add support to receive byteCode for given contractId

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

### Breaking changes and new features
- [#77](../../../issues/77) integrate middleware `aeternal` and allow to query ÆNS auction related information
- [#72](../../../issues/72) add method to post transactions with a custom private key 
- [#70](../../../issues/70) adapt TLD changes (`.chain` instead of `.aet`)
- [#68](../../../issues/68) refactoring: rename contractBaseUrl to compilerBaseUrl
- [#65](../../../issues/65) refactoring: allow posting of signed transactions (string)
- [#64](../../../issues/64) ÆNS: auction-related functionalities
  - calculate the next minimum fee for a running auction
- [#63](../../../issues/63) refactoring: dryRun actions
- [#56](../../../issues/56) Lima related changes:
  - update to new node version `v5.x.x`
  - ÆNS auctions:
     - TLD: `.aet` instead of `.test`
     - `nameFee` calculation
     - adapt changes in generation of `commitmentId` and `nameId`
     - update version of `NameClaimTx`
  - update to new compiler version `v4.x.x`:
     - adapt sophia contracts to compile with new version
  - FATE-VM:
     - make the compiler-backend configurable (`AEVM` / `FATE`)
     - introduce `VirtualMachine` enum and add it to the `ServiceConfiguration` so that the services in the SDK use the correct `vmVersion` and `abiVersion` combination and the correct `backend` in the compiler
- [#44](../../../issues/44) major refactoring:
  - introduced model classes to be independent from the swagger-generated classes
  - discarded the `TransactionFactory` -> for each transaction-type a model class was introduced which can be created following the builder-pattern
  - introduced the `AeternityService` which serves as entrypoint to access other services and needs to be instantiated through the `AeternityServiceFactory` by passing the `AeternityServiceConfiguration`
