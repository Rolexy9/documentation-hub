Quick Glossary
=====
This quick glossary contains many of the terms used in relation to aeternity.

### *Account*
An object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code. An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).

### *AENS*
The æternity Naming System enables user-friendly identities for blockchain entities, such as user accounts, oracles, contracts, etc.

### *æpp*
A decentralized application built on æternity blockchain. At a minimum, it is a smart contract and a web user interface. More broadly, an æpp is a web application that is built in top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services.

### *Address*
Most generally, this represents an EOA or contract that can receive (destination address) or send (source address) transactions on the blockchain. More specifically, it is the rightmost 160 bits of a Keccak hash of an ECDSA public key.

### *Block*
A collection of required information (a block header) about the comprised transactions, and a set of other block headers  known as ommers. Blocks are added to the æternity network by miners.

### *Blockchain*
In æternity, a sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block. This varies from the Bitcoin protocol in that it does not have a block size limit; it instead uses varying gas limits.

### *DAO*
Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A company or other organization that operates without hierachical management. Also may refer to a contract names "The DAO" launched on April 30, 2016, which was then hacked in June 2016; this ultimately motivated a hard fork (codenamed DAO) at block #1,192,000, which reversed the hacked DAO contract and caused Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to split into two competing systems.

### *Faucet*
A service that dispenses funds in the form of free test ættos that can be used on a testnet.

### *Fork*
A change in protocol causing the creation of an alternative chain, or a temporal divergence in two potential block paths during mining.

### *Gas*
A virtual fuel used in Ethereum to execute smart contracts. The aesophia uses accounting mechanism to measure the consumption of gas and limit the consumption of computing resources.

### *Gas limit*
The maximum amount of gas a tranction or block may consume.

### *Genesis block*
The first block in a blockchain, used to initialize a particular network and its cryptocurrency.

### *Hard fork*
A permanent divergence in the blockchain; also known as a hard-forking change. One commonly occurs when nonupgrated nodes can not validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules. Not to be confused with a fork, soft fork, software fork, or Git fork.

### *Hash*
A fixed-length fingerprint of variable-size input, produced by a hash function.

### *IDE*
Integrated Development Environment. A user interface that typically combines a code editor, compiler, runtime, and debugger.

### *Miner*
A network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.

### *SDK*
Software development kit is typically a set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or similar development platform. To enrich applications with advanced functionalities, advertisements, push notifications, and more, most app developers implement specific software development kits. æternity’s SDKs (JavaScript, Python and Golang) are critical for developing an æpp.

### *Smart Contract*
A program that executes on the æternity computing infrastructure.

### *Testnet*
Short for "test network", a network used to simulate the behavior of the main æternity network.

### *Transaction*
Data committed to the æternity Blockchain signed by an originating account, targeting a specific address. The transaction contains metadata such as the gas limit for that transaction.

### *Wallet*
Software that holds secret keys. Used to access and control æternity accounts and interact with smart contracts. Keys need not be stored in a wallet, and can instead be retrieved from offline storage (e.g., a memory card or paper) for improved security. Despite the name, wallets never store the actual coins or tokens.

### *Turing complete*
A concept named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing; a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be "Turing complete" or "computationally universal" if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine.
