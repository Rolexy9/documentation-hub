# INTRODUCTION
## Welcome to æternity's Documentation Hub! (work in progress)

This Documentation Hub will be your best technical guide on æternity as a whole based on the model of the “Mastering Bitcoin” book, mainly focused on dApp (aepp) developer and miner. It should help you to clear the haze around æternity’s technology and whole ecosystem with a clear structure and well written documentation. æternity’s Documentation Hub should become your guide through the seemingly complex ecosystem of æternity, providing the knowledge you need for participating and mastering æternity. Whether you’re building the next killer aepp, investing in a startup, or simply curious about the technology itself, it will provide all essential details to get you started and to accompany you through your personal journey till æternity.
