# TUTORIAL: Deploying Sophia smart contracts with init parameters

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will walk you through the deployment of smart contracts with init parameters through the use of forgae.

## Prerequisites

You have completed [this tutorial](smart-contract-deployment-in-forgae.md) that teaches you how to deploy a contract without init parameters.

## Step 0: Create a project and Run your forgae node

We would need a local node to compile and deploy on. The easiest option is to spawn one from forgae. Follow the below steps to create a project, initilize the project and test the project using forgae on your CLI

```
Step 1: $ mkdir forgae-init
Step 2: $ cd forgae-init
Step 3: $ forgae init
Step 4: $ forgae node
```

Do not forget to stop it once you are done developing

```
forgae node --stop
```

## Step 1: Update your ExampleContract.aes

Lets add some state and init parameters to our example contract which can be found at **contracts/ExampleContract.aes**

```
contract ExampleContract =

  record state = { saved_string : string }

  entrypoint init() = { saved_string = "aeternity" }

  public entrypoint get_string() : string =
	  state.saved_string

  public stateful entrypoint register_string(word : string) =
	  put(state { saved_string = word})
```

As you can see the contract now has a state variable `saved_string` of type `string`. The initial value will be passed by the init function. We've also added a read function `get_string` for this value and a write function `register_string` to write and change the value in `saved_string`.

Run forgae compile to verify that your contract compiles successfully

```
forgae compile
```

## Step 2. Update your deploy.js

Lets add some parameters to our example deploy script which can be found at **deployment/deploy.js**. The parameters of the init functions are always passed as tuple. Here is how our new deploy script looks like

```
const Deployer = require('forgae-lib').Deployer;

const deploy = async (network, privateKey, compiler) => {
    let deployer = new Deployer(network, privateKey, compiler)

    let contract = await deployer.deploy("./contracts/ExampleContract.aes")

    // Getting savedString value in our ExampleContract
    let get_string = await contract.decode('get_string')
    console.log(get_string.value)

    // Writing new value ('hello world') to our saved_string
    await contract.call('register_string', 'hello world')

    // Getting new saved_string value in our ExampleContract
    let get_string2 = await contract.decode('get_string')
    console.log(get_string2.value)
};

module.exports = {
    deploy
};
```

As you can see, we got our first initial value of `aeternity` then we are add a new value `hello world` as a tuple string and finally got the new value.

## Step 3. Run our deploy script

Running our deployment script with forgae is trivial. Just run :
```
forgae deploy
```

You will see in your terminal the value of the saved string - aeternity.

## Conclusion

Smart contracts are frequently in need of init params. Keep in mind the specifics of tuples and you will be able to successfully initialize your awesome Aeternity smart contracts.
